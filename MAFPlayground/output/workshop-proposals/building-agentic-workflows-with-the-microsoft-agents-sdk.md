# Building Agentic Workflows with the Microsoft Agents SDK

## Workshop Details

**Duration:** 4 hours

**Target Audience:** Intermediate developers familiar with C#, .NET, and basic AI/LLM concepts.

## Overview

This 4-hour intermediate-level workshop enables C# and .NET developers to understand, design, and implement agentic workflows using the Microsoft Agents SDK. Through a combination of guided learning and practical labs, participants will explore the SDK architecture, integrate with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), build multi-step workflows, and leverage structured outputs and tool-calling to create intelligent, context-aware AI agents.

## Workshop Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to the Microsoft Agents SDK

**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the fundamental architecture of the Microsoft Agents SDK.
- Explain the core components and their roles in building agent workflows.
- Set up the development environment for working with Agents SDK.

**Content Sources:**
- [Introduction to Microsoft Agents SDK (MicrosoftLearn)](https://learn.microsoft.com/agents-sdk/intro)
  - *Used to introduce participants to the SDK and core concepts.*

**Activities:**
- Guided tour of Microsoft Agents documentation and architecture diagram.
- Setup and verification of development environment using Visual Studio.

### Module 3: Hands-on Lab: Implementing Agentic Workflows

**Duration:** 100 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Apply learned concepts to build a functional agent workflow.
- Demonstrate the use of Agents SDK samples in real scenarios.
- Experiment with tool-calling and multi-step flows.

**Content Sources:**
- [microsoft/agents-sdk-samples (GitHub)](https://github.com/microsoft/agents-sdk-samples)
  - *Used as the practical foundation for the hands-on lab with sample implementations.*

**Activities:**
- Clone and explore the Agents SDK samples repository.
- Implement a custom workflow leveraging one of the provided samples.
- Test and debug your workflow locally.

### Module 4: Integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**Duration:** 85 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand how MCP enables context sharing and interoperability.
- Learn to integrate MCP servers with agentic workflows.
- Implement real-world integration using example MCP servers.

**Content Sources:**
- [ModelContextProtocol/servers (GitHub)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
  - *Provides hands-on content and examples for MCP integration.*

**Activities:**
- Examine MCP server examples on GitHub.
- Integrate an MCP server into the previously built agent workflow.
- Demonstrate context fetching between the agent and MCP.

### Module 5: Structured Outputs and Advanced Tool-Calling

**Duration:** 50 minutes

**Learning Objectives:**
- Leverage structured outputs to generate predictable, machine-consumable results.
- Enhance workflow robustness through structured data exchanges.
- Implement tool-calling patterns using structured outputs.

**Content Sources:**
- [Structured Outputs with AI (MicrosoftLearn)](https://learn.microsoft.com/ai/structured-outputs)
  - *Helps learners understand and implement structured output definitions in their agents.*

**Activities:**
- Guided review of structured output definitions from MicrosoftLearn.
- Modify your workflow to include structured outputs and validate their format.
- Mini-challenge: Add a new tool-call step that uses structured responses.
